🔐 What is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting plain, readable data into unreadable, scrambled data to protect it from unauthorized access.

📌 Example:
You type “Hello” → Encryption turns it into “7x@A#92!d” (cipher text).

Only someone with the correct key can turn it back into the original message.

🔸 Why Encryption is used?

To protect sensitive information

To secure data in transit (e.g., WhatsApp messages, HTTPS)

To secure data at rest (e.g., passwords, files)

🔓 What is Decryption?

Decryption is the reverse process of encryption.

It converts the scrambled, unreadable data (cipher text) back into original, readable data (plain text) using a key.

📌 Example:
Cipher text “7x@A#92!d” → Decryption → “Hello”

🔑 Simple Analogy

Encryption = locking your message with a key

Decryption = unlocking the message with the key
