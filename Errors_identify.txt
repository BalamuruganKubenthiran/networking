🖧 What Are Networking Errors?

Networking errors are problems that stop computers or devices from communicating with each other over a network (LAN, WAN, Internet).

These errors can occur in:

DNS (domain name resolution)

IP address / routing

DHCP

Firewall

Switch / VLAN

WiFi

Servers / ports

Applications (HTTP, TCP, etc.)

A networking error means something in the communication path is broken.

🔍 How to Identify Networking Errors (Step-by-step)

Think of it like troubleshooting from Layer 1 to Layer 7.

1️⃣ Check Physical Layer (Cables, Ports, Link Light)

Common symptoms:

No internet

Cable unplugged

Port blinking orange or not blinking

WiFi not connecting

How to identify:

Check if the network cable is connected

Check if port lights are ON

Test with another cable / port

2️⃣ Check IP Address Problems

Symptoms:

Wrong IP

APIPA 169.254.x.x

“Network unreachable”

How to identify:

Run ip a or ifconfig

Verify IP, subnet mask, default gateway

Ping your gateway:

ping 192.168.1.1

3️⃣ Check DNS Errors

Symptoms:

Only websites not loading

“DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN”

“Server not found”

How to identify:

Try pinging domain:

ping google.com


Try pinging IP:

ping 8.8.8.8


If IP works and domain fails → DNS issue.

4️⃣ Check Routing Issues

Symptoms:

“Destination host unreachable”

“Request timed out”

How to identify:

Check routing table:

ip r


Trace route:

traceroute google.com

5️⃣ Check Firewall Blocking

Symptoms:

Application not accessible

Cannot connect to a port

“Connection refused”

How to identify:

Check firewall:

sudo ufw status


Test port:

telnet IP port

6️⃣ Check Server/Service Problems

Symptoms:

Website running but showing 500, 502, 503

Cannot connect to MySQL, Apache, Nginx

How to identify:

Check service status:

systemctl status nginx
systemctl status mysql


Check logs for errors

7️⃣ Check WiFi Issues

Symptoms:

Low signal

Authentication failed

Frequent disconnects

How to identify:

Check WiFi signal strength

Restart router

Try another device

🧪 Most Common Networking Errors & How They Look
Error	Meaning
Destination Host Unreachable	No route to device
Request Timed Out	No reply from device
DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN	DNS cannot find domain
Connection Refused	Port is closed / service down
APIPA 169.254.x.x	DHCP server not giving IP
404 Not Found	Server can't find the page
500/502/503	Server internal error
